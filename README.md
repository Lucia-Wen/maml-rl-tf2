# Reinforcement Learning with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) in TensorFlow 2
Working on the implementation of *Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)* applied on Reinforcement Learning problems in TensorFlow 2. 

This repo is heavily inspired by the original implementation [cbfinn/maml_rl](https://github.com/cbfinn/maml_rl/) and a very clear implementation from students at MILA [tristandeleu/pytorch-maml-rl](https://github.com/tristandeleu/pytorch-maml-rl). I totally recommend to check out both implementations too.

## WIP
This repo is currently under work.

## References
This project is, for the most part, a reproduction of the original implementation [cbfinn/maml_rl](https://github.com/cbfinn/maml_rl/) in TensorFlow 2. These experiments are based on the paper
